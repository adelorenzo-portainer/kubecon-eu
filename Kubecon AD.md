**Title**:

Containerized Applications & Kubernetes Invisibility - can this be achieved and why is it important

**Abstract:**

Historically the IT industry strives to hide complexity. We have seen this happen systematically with cellphones, X-aaS (S,P,I, C, etc...), CSPs, MSPs. Will this happen to Containers and Kubernetes? If so, how long will this take and why is it so important. We will see the benefits and technology invisibility and what is our role as IT professionals in achieving this.
